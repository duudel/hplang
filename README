The language will be procedural with:
- static typing
- simple type inference
- a few primitive datatypes:
 - signed & unsigned integers of sizes 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits
 - boolean
 - 8 bit character
 - raw pointers

these features have less priority:
- multiple return values from procedures
- possibility to define structures containing other types
- string datatype
- floating point numbers of sizes 32 and 64
- compile time code execution
 - for meta programming
