The language will be procedural with:
- static typing
- simple type inference
- a few primitive datatypes:
 - signed & unsigned integers of sizes 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits
 - boolean
 - 8 bit character
 - raw pointers

these features have less priority:
- multiple return values from procedures
- possibility to define structures containing other types
- string datatype
- floating point numbers of sizes 32 and 64
- compile time code execution
 - for meta programming

The target language is AMD64 for Windows (and maybe Linux).


; A simple program that prints the team name in AMD64 (for NASM)

global main
extern puts
section .text

main:
    sub     rsp, 0x20
    lea     rcx, [hello]
    call    puts
    mov     eax, 0
    add     rsp, 0x20
    ret

align 8
hello:
    db "hplang", 0
