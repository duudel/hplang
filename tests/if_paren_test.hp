// Testing parenthesis around if statement condition
// 2016-04-26

main :: ()
{
    if x == 5 { &y = 10; }
    // Error:
    //if (x == 5) &y = 10;
    if x == 5  &y = 10;
    // Could be interpreted (by human) as
    //   if ((x == (5 & y)) = 10) ;
    // if (assign 10 to (x equals (5 bitand y))) then empty stmt.
    // or
    //   if (x == 5)  &y = 10;
    // if (x equals 5) then assign 10 to the address of y.

    // The first version is what the parser sees.
    // Both seem to be contrieved, semantically nonsensical, and the problem
    // might not happen in real code. Thus it will not be critical, if this
    // behaviour is allowed. In long term though, it would be better, if this
    // problem could be addressed.
